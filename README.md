AngularJS template
==================

## Introduction

This demo is based on [Rubens García's](http://rubensdev.com/) [FLAT TODO app](https://github.com/rubensdev/todo-app). It has been adapted in order to have a cordova based structure. 

This demo is built using [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) and [Cocoon Webview+](https://cocoon.io/doc/webview_plus) in portrait view and fullscreen. 

## How to use this repo

In order to test this repo at the cloud compiler, you can select this template directly in the guided creation wizard or just copy the .git url from this repo and create a github based project. 

This template is fully configured and adapted so you can compile the project just after creation and testing it in your devices as soon as the compilation is complete. 

## Structure

This repository has this basic structure: 
`````````````````
template/
|-- config.xml
|-- res/
|	|-- android/
|	|-- ios/
| 	`-- screen/
`-- www/
``````````````````
* **res:** This folder contains all the icons for Android, iOS and the splash screens used in the project.

* **www:** This folder contains the source code of the project. 

* **config.xml:** This file contains the project configuration.

As you can see, it is not neccessary to include *plugins*, *platforms* or *hooks*.
